## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need a modern web browser. The project uses Tailwind CSS, but the compiled CSS file is included, so no installation is required to simply run it.

### Running the Application

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BeFit.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BeFit.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd BeFit/dist
    ```
3.  Open the `BeFit2.0.html` file in your browser to view the application.

### Development

If you want to make changes to the styles:
1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Install Tailwind CSS:
    ```sh
    npm install -D tailwindcss
    ```
3.  Run the Tailwind CLI to watch for changes and rebuild your CSS:
    ```sh
    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create the `src/input.css` file to contain your Tailwind directives if it doesn't exist.)*

* **Expand Exercise Library:** Integrate a comprehensive database of exercises covering all muscle groups and equipment types.
* **Full Backend Integration:** Implement a full-featured backend with a database to manage user accounts, save preferences, and track progress.
